\title{ITTIK}
\author{Olaf Booij}

\maketitle

The KITTI dataset is a standard for evaluating R\&D in autonomous
driving and mapping. An important part of the used sensor setup is a
surround LiDAR sensor which captures ranges and reflectivity of the
structures and objects around the vehicle.
This LiDAR data is not presented as raw sensor readings, which are hard
to interpret. Rather, the data is preprocessed into easy to comprehend
single scan 3D point clouds measured in a single 360 degrees rotation.
Generic point cloud software can be used to visualize and process such
data.

A drawback of the point clouds is that it is difficult to get the
precise time for each of the 3d point measurements. In addition, it is
difficult to compute the exact origin of the cast LiDAR rays. A more
general concern is that the point clouds do not reflect the dense and
structured form of the LiDAR measurement.

ITTIK tries to get back the raw LiDAR sensor data by undoing the steps
performed during the KITTI preprocessing. It does so using the KITTI
point clouds, as well as the available calibration data.

\section{Velodyne data}
% sensor
The LiDAR sensor used for the KITTI dataset is a Velodyne HDL-64E. This
device fires its 64 individual lasers with a frequency of 20 KHz, while
the device is rotating at a rate of 10 Hz, resulting in approximately
130,000 measurements per scan and 1.3 million measurements per
second. The 64 lasers do not fire at the same time. Instead, at each
timestep, two of the lasers fire in a fixed sequence. Because the device
keeps on rotating, each pair of points has a unique measurement time as
well as a unique device orientation.

The rays of each laser have a different vertical and horizontal
direction. In addition, the lasers are distributed over 4 locations on
the device resulting in a slightly different offset of the ray origin.
The exact value of these directions and offsets are given in the
calibration stored on the device (more on this in the next section).
In Figure~\ref{fig:directions} the different directions of the laser
rays are shown. As can be seen the vertical view-angle is approximately
28 degrees and the horizontal view-angle 19 degrees.

    }
    \caption{Direction of each laser, plotted with there index, as
    indicated in the calibration file in degrees.}
		\label{fig:directions}
\end{figure}

It is important to understand the implications of this horizontal view
angle. Points from the same scan that are close to each other in the
scene, have a different measurement time. Take for example laser \#41
and laser \#46 (see Figure~\ref{fig:directions}). Verticaly, they are
``neighbors'', but horizontally they are 19 degrees apart.

Thus, it is not easy to get information from the measurements of a
single fire of all lasers. It is like a depth camera where only 64
pixels are working spread over the image plane. A point cloud
representations is much more useful.

Still, for this point cloud we should consider that the device for the
example lasers has to rotate 19 degrees, before they measure the same
structure. Taking the rotation speed into account, two very close points
in the scene will have been measured with a time difference of
$\frac{19}{360} 100 \, \mbox{ms}= 5 \, \mbox{ms}$.

This time difference has to be taken into acount of course when
processing the data. KITTI contains, in addition to the ``raw'' point
clouds, motion corrected data, in which the vehicle motion is
compensatad for, for each laser. For moving objects, however, this is of
course more difficult.

In addition, the spread of the lasers, and their non-monotinic firing
behavior (more about that later), results in a non-uniform point cloud,
hard to feed into standard image processing tools such as convolutional
neural networks.
